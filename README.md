# NDPoké (Working title)

This is a custom game based on the Pokémon Emerald decompilation project.

# Game design goals

* Streamline the new game experience while still providing solid tutorials for first time players
* Provide a fixed or adaptive difficulty curve that delivers engaging, strategy-based combat
* A traditional Pokémon adventure with an interesting cast of characters
* Satisfying post-game battles and hidden events

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
